NOTE: kwartz is still under development. Expect bugs and unfinished features. Also, I am prioritizing development of Flux Editor, so this project may be less actively developed.

## Installation

There are currently no built binaries available. To run kwartz, you have to build from source. See <a href="#building">Building</a> for more details.

## Building <a name="building"></a>

Make sure you have Rust 1.90 installed before building.
To build kwartz from source, you must first clone this repo using

You may also run
